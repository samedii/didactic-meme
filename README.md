A modelling suite with extra focus on pytorch

* Speed up the modelling process
* Increase traceability of trained models
* Easier model comparison and highscores
* Visualize model predictions
* Easily expose model via web api

## TODO

- [ ] Save models by epoch
- [ ] Score models and list highscore
- [ ] Tensorboardx
- [ ] Need to handle custom pre-processing
